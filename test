Born in Indonesia in which the country's currency has experienced enormous inflation, it has been very arduous for my parent to support my education up to this point. Although I acquired my degree from a US university mostly through my parent's financial support, the toll that it took on my parents are that both of them have to take up multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. Even more, both my older and younger sibling have to stay in Indonesia to fulfill their degree due to my parent's financial shortage. Throughout my time at university, although I am unable to secure a lot of scholarship, I have done my best to help my parent by working constantly more than twenty hours a week every semester in tutoring, grading, teaching assistant, research assistant and internship.

Graduating from one of the best universities in the world at the age of 19 with the involvement in multiple honor societies such as Alpha Gamma Sigma and Eta Kappa Nu, I believe that I am an excellent candidate to these scholarships. Furthermore, I have accumulated extensive relevant research experience for the past two years as demonstrated by my string of publications and technical reports in top-tier conferences such as EuroSys. Combining this with the courseworks that I have taken, including graduate-level ones such as cloud computing and computer systems, I have a great potential to succeed in my graduate studies.
