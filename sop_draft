Q1) If you have worked on a research project, either for your first degree or subsequently, please describe your work below; your account should be intelligible to anyone who is not a specialist in your field. If you have no such research experience, leave this space blank; a blank entry will not prejudice your application. PLEASE DO NOT COPY AND PASTE FROM A WORD OR SIMILAR DOCUMENT, BUT TYPE DIRECTLY INTO THIS FIELD. (max 10 lines, each with a maximum of 130 characters - including spaces)

    For the past one year and a half, I have been conducting research under the supervision of Professor John Kubiatowicz that revolves around Berkeley's very own ManyCore Operating System (OS), Tessellation, which is aimed at investigating new OS structures that can simultaneously support real-time, responsive, and high-throughput parallel applications. My work in this project began with designing and implementing its Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in Linux. I also ported the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) to Tessellation to enable better device discoveries and power management in the OS. More recently, I improved the Tessellation QoS models to handle dynamic changes (e.g. the users would like to demand more network bandwidth for his skype session) in the system. When the paper deadlines were approaching, my focus shifted to implementing and automating the process of running the experiments followed by parsing the results and constructing the graphs. My contribution to the project has resulted in a poster presented at HotChips 2011 and two publications that are submitted to EuroSys 2012 and CATA 2012 which are currently in-review.

Q2) Title and statement of your research degree proposal, or reason for wanting to undertake the course. The Department to which you are applying may in addition require a separate, more detailed, research proposal; check the online Qualifications Directory for further information.

    With the illusion of infinite resources and the elasticity that comes with it, the advent of cloud computing has opened up many doors to developers with innovative ideas for internet services. However, currently cloud computing system typically does not take into account the possible heterogeneity that exist in the clusters. Thus, developers will not be able to take advantage of the different architectures that are well-suited to a specific task. This is aggravated by the fact that the users' demand may vary. For instance, currently the users' jobs only need to use CPU since it is just a sequential job but at later point in time, their jobs are best executed by GPU. Since cloud computing system currently assumes homogenous hardwares, this possible optimization goes undetected. It will be ideal if the users' job instance is migrated to another machine that has a decent GPU to carry out the job. Although there are works that explore the use of GPU acceleration to speed up cloud management tasks, there has been no published result on incorporating this into virtual machine migration; When to migrate? Where to migrate? If these questions are answered, the performance of the jobs that are running in the cloud will improve tremendously. With the caliber of the faculties in Cambridge who invented Xen, one of the most prevalent VM monitors, I believe that the ACS program in Cambridge will be the best match for my endeavor to investigate the aforementioned problem.

Q3) You may write here your non-academic activities or any special circumstances not evident from other answers in this application, that you wish to draw to the attention of the assessors of your application. The Department to which you are applying may require a CV to be submitted with your application, check the online Qualifications Directory for further information. If you are seeking funding from the Cambridge Trusts, you will be asked to give more details of your achievements in a separate section.

    Beyond research and coursework, I have been involved with education too. I was a tutor in multiple subjects such as Math and Computer Science in high school and college. Here at UC Berkeley, I have served in the HKN EECS honor society committee to hold tutoring hours for EECS undergraduates. However, my most significant teaching experience was as a teaching assistant for an upper-division operating system class taught by Professor John Kubiatowicz since it is highly relevant to my research and my future dream of becoming a professor.
    Additionally, I have engaged extensively in leadership activities. In college, I have established a soccer club in there, served as an IT officer in the Alpha Gamma Sigma honor society and more recently, served in the HKN EECS honor society at Berkeley for 3 semesters now as a computing service officer that maintained the club's website and server.

Q4) Please give an outline of your future career plans and intentions and explain how your proposed studies in Cambridge will help to achieve these aims.

    My long-term goal is to remain in academia as a professor, contributing to both the systems research community and undergraduate education. In order for me to realize my ambition, I believe that the ACS program in Cambridge will be a good stepping stone for me to identify the research area that would enthrall me the most. Additionally, I believe that teaching is an integral part of professorship. Thus, I'm also attracted by the strength of the undergraduate program, since I look forward to teaching as a graduate student.
