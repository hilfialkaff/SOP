For the past one year and a half, I have been conducting research under the supervision of Professor John Kubiatowicz that revolves around Berkeley's very own ManyCore Operating System (OS), Tessellation, which is aimed at investigating new OS structures that can simultaneously support real-time, responsive, and high-throughput parallel applications. My work in this project began with designing and implementing its Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in Linux. I also ported the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) to Tessellation to enable better device discoveries and power management in the OS. More recently, I improved the Tessellation QoS models to handle dynamic changes (e.g. the users would like to demand more network bandwidth for his skype session) in the system. When the paper deadlines were approaching, my focus shifted to implementing and automating the process of running the experiments followed by parsing the results and constructing the graphs. My contribution to the project has resulted in a poster presented at HotChips 2011 and two publications that are submitted to EuroSys 2012 and CATA 2012 which are currently in-review.

Q2) Title and statement of your research degree proposal, or reason for wanting to undertake the course. The Department to which you are applying may in addition require a separate, more detailed, research proposal; check the online Qualifications Directory for further information.

With the illusion of infinite resources and the elasticity that comes with it, the advent of cloud computing has opened up many doors to developers with innovative ideas for internet services. However, currently cloud computing system typically does not take into account the possible heterogeneity that exist in the clusters. Thus, developers will not be able to take advantage of the different architectures that are well-suited to a specific task. This is aggravated by the fact that the users' demand may vary. For instance, currently the users' jobs only need to use CPU since it is just a sequential job but at later point in time, their jobs are best executed by GPU. Since cloud computing system currently assumes homogenous hardwares, this possible optimization goes undetected. It will be ideal if the users' job instance is migrated to another machine that has a decent GPU to carry out the job. Although there are works that explore the use of GPU acceleration to speed up cloud management tasks, there has been no published results on incorporating this into virtual machine migration; If a user's demand changes, should it be migrated? If so, to which machine? If these questions are answered, the performance of the jobs that are running in the cloud will improve tremendously. With the caliber of the faculties in Cambridge who invented Xen, one of the most prevalent VM monitors, I believe that the ACS program in Cambridge will be the best match for my endeavor to investigate the aforementioned problem.

When I transferred to UC Berkeley from community college, my family's financial situation is exacerbated since the tuition fee is much higher and thus, I needed to work much more hours (~20 hours a week) than when I was in community college previously. Since research is not promoted at all in my community college, I was not aware that I needed research experience to enroll in a prestigious graduate school. Thus, in addition to my working hours and coursework, I am undertaking research project too at the same time. This causes my GPA to take a plunge when I enrolled in UC Berkeley. However, I have acquired extensive research experience, which is an integral part of succeeding in graduate school, as shown by my list of publications and thus, I believe that I am a befitting candidate in the ACS program.

	I have engaged extensively in leadership activities. In college, I have established a soccer club, served in the student body council to promote inter club activities and acted as an IT officer in the Alpha Gamma Sigma (AGS) honor society to maintain the club's website and connect with all of the other AGS chapters in America. At Berkeley, I have served in the HKN EECS honor society for 3 semesters as a computing service officer that provides tutoring and councilling for the EECS undergraduates while at the same time maintains the club's website and server. I have also served as an officer in Berkeley Indonesian Student Association to promote awareness of the Indonesian cultures and to provide a closely knit family for Indonesians studying at Berkeley.
	Moreover, I have participated in community services on many occasions. When I was in community college, I helped in organizing drives to collect used books and clothes to be donated to the needy people in Africa. I also volunteered in a non-profitable organization that accepts any unused items and reselling it back to the community in which the acquired profit will be donated.

Q4) Please give an outline of your future career plans and intentions and explain how your proposed studies in Cambridge will help to achieve these aims.

My long-term goal is to remain in academia as a professor, contributing to both the systems research community and undergraduate education. In addition, becoming a professor will empower me to further ameliorate the quality of life of the humankind through the development of useful computing technologies, establishing a better relationship between industry and academia to share the same vision or even encouraging my own students to apply their engineering skills to benefit the humanity. Thus, in order for me to realize my ambition, I believe that the ACS program in Cambridge will be a good stepping stone for me to identify the research area that would enthrall me the most while benefitting the humanity at the same time. Finally, I believe that teaching is an integral part of professorship and thus, I'm also attracted by the strength of the undergraduate program in Cambridge. By studying in Cambridge, I will be able to contrast the teaching styles in my previous institution (UC Berkeley) and in Europe and take the best of both worlds.

If you wish to apply for a Gates Cambridge Scholarship, please describe below – in not more than 500 words – how your interests and achievements, both academic and extra-curricular, demonstrate a capacity for leadership and a commitment to improving the lives of others.

My long-term goal is to remain in academia as a professor, contributing to both education and ameliorating the quality of humankind as a whole. Since the field of computer science is currently advancing rapidly, I believe that there are a lot of opportunities for me for me to achieve my goal. In developing countries such as Indonesia where research is not that prevalent, becoming a professor will enable me to establish a better relationship between industry and academia to share the same vision to benefit the lives of others. Exploring how to establish a better network infrastructure will be very beneficial. This way, the locals will be able to receive notifications about any impending natural disasters and evacuate safely for example. Additionally, I could even encourage my own students to apply their engineering skills to benefit the humanity too. Thus, in order for me to realize my ambition, I believe that the ACS program in Cambridge will be a good stepping stone for me to identify the research area that would enthrall me the most while benefitting the humanity at the same time

Born in Indonesia in which the country's currency has experienced enormous inflation, it has been very arduous for my parent to support my education up to this point. Although I acquired my degree from a US university mostly through my parent's financial support, the toll that it took on my parents are that both of them have to take up multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. Even more, all of my siblings have to stay in Indonesia to fulfill their degree due to my parent's financial shortage. Throughout my time at university, although I am unable to secure a lot of scholarship, I have done my best to help my parent by working constantly more than twenty hours a week every semester in tutoring, grading, teaching assistant and internship.

Graduating from UC Berkeley, one of the best universities in the world at the age of 19 with academic honors on most of the semesters, I believe that I am an excellent candidate to these scholarships. Furthermore, I have accumulated extensive research experience for the past two years as demonstrated by my list of publications and technical reports in top-tier conferences such as EuroSys. Combining this with the courseworks that I have taken, including graduate-level ones such as cloud computing and computer systems, I have a great potential to succeed in my graduate studies.
