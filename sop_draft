Write a short personal statement (200 to 500 words) in your own words, describing your motivation for studying in the selected programme.

My career aspiration is to be a professor in computer science, contributing to the research community, undergraduate education and most importantly, the society as a whole. In the current era where computers of one form or another are ubiquitous and influence our everyday life significantly, being a professor will give me a lot of potentials in ameliorating the quality of life in the society. This is exactly the reason that I am applying for a graduate program.

My interest in computer systems research is sparked when I came to study in the United States (US) from my hometown in Indonesia. (I realized how much more productive my life is due to the difference in technologies between the two countries. For instance, I am able to browse technical papers much faster due to the better network infrastructures that are established in the US) (kok pusing y bacana ini 2 sentence, flowny krng gini, gmn dunks). Fueled by my newly-found interest to explore the area of systems, I have been conducting research with Professor John Kubiatowicz and the Par Lab operating systems group for the past two years. Specifically, I help design and implement Tessellation, our manycore OS. Experiencing a large-scale systems project, from the early conceptual design stages through implementation and evaluation, has been extremely fruitful. My experiences with the Par Lab have helped in refining my research interests while preparing me for future systems research.

ETH stands out due to the caliber of the faculties in the systems group and the interesting system projects that are being carried out such as Barrelfish Operating System which I frequently refer to when implementing Tessellation. The MSc program will be an excellent next step for me since it will allow me some times to identify the research area which is fascinating and beneficial for humankind at the same time before getting my PhD. Finally, since I believe that teaching is an integral part of professorship, I'm attracted by the strength of the undergraduate program in ETH Zurich as I look forward to teaching as a graduate student. For these reasons, I believe that the MSc program at ETH is the best match for my interest.
