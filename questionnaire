The M.Phil in Advanced Computer Science is designed for students wishing to continue to read for the Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science. Like a PhD application, therefore, we need you to give us a 'research proposal.' This will help us to identify potential research groups and potential supervisors. Please write one or two brief research proposals of no more than 500 words each. You may wish to look at the research pages of the various groups to find the latest areas of interest.
